# About this fork

This is a fork of jamesblack's repo, which was an improvement on Sindusk's DiscordRelay, which was an updated and
wyvernmods-compatible version of whisper2shade's original DiscordRelay mod.

## The changes
 - Updated to the latest alpha release of JDA, 5.0.0-alpha.19
 - Fixed not sending messages from discord to wurm in ca-help
 - Added option to not count alts as separate players in the bot's presence text.
 - Added support for a handful of emojis, so they show up as ascii emoticons in-game ('ðŸ˜„'  will show up as ':D').
